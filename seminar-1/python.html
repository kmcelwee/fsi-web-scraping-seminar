<h2 id="tips-on-learning-how-to-code">Tips on learning how to code</h2>

<p>The following are pieces of advice from programmers at the CDH and the library:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google is a programmer’s best friend. Any problem you have, there’s a 99.9 percent
chance another person has had that exact problem before.</li>
  <li>There are so many free resources on the internet to help you. Use them!</li>
  <li>This is just writing instructions. Programming isn’t math. Don’t count yourself out just because you aren’t the best at mathematics.</li>
  <li>The best way to become a coder is to code. Try things out. Mess up.</li>
  <li>We’re starting with python, but programming language really doesn’t matter. The 
most important thing is to get started.</li>
  <li>Don’t expect to understand a topic the first time around. Be kind to yourself, this is a whole new way of thinking.</li>
  <li>Be persistent. Coding takes time, and the solution is out there. You will figure
it out if you keep working at it!</li>

<p>If you don’t know how to proceed, try googling the solution. Prepare an answer
before clicking the “View Solution” button.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 1:</strong> Create a list of all integers between 1 and 10 and assign it to a variable. Print them out.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 2:</strong> Write a sentence and store it as a variable. Write a function to return the
word count of that sentence.</p>

</details>

<p><strong>Exercise 3:</strong> Make a dictionary that translates each letter of the alphabet into it’s
corresponding place in the alphabet (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"a" =&gt; 1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"b" =&gt; 2</code>)</p>

</details>

<p><strong>Exercise 4:</strong> Write a function that turns a word into a list of numbers that corresponds with their placement in the alphabet. Use the dictionary you created in the previous exercise.
For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">translate_word('princeton')</code> would return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[16, 18, 9, 14, 3, 5, 20, 15, 14]</code></p>

<p><strong>Exercise 5:</strong> What are some errors you could encounter when writing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">translate_word</code> function?</p>

<details><summary><a class="btn btn-purple">View Solution</a></summary>

<ul>
    <li>We would get an error if we fed <code>'Princeton'</code> into the function because it contains
        an uppercase letter. (Try it out to see what kind of error you would get.)
To ensure that the string is lowercase, use <code>word = word.lower()</code>.</li>
    <li>This function expects a word. If we fed <code>'FSI Class of 2025!'</code> into it, it would cause
an error because the blank space character and the exclamation point isn't in our dictionary.
Python's <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_isalpha.htm"><code>str.isalpha()</code></a>
function can tell us if any of the characters in a string aren't a letter.
</li>
</ul>

With these considerations in mind, we can rewrite this function.

</details>

<p>Code is never finished! We could keep rewriting many of these functions forever.
Don’t get too wrapped up in making your code “perfect”. Write code that is clear,
well-documented, and serves your ultimate research question.</p>
