<h1 id="introduction-to-colab">Introduction to Colab</h1>

<p>Google Colab is an online platform to write computer code in what‚Äôs called a 
code ‚Äúnotebook‚Äù. Notebooks allow programmers to combine charts, text, and code
in one place. Typically, programmers write code in files on their computers
and then run those programs on their own computer, but that requires some setup
that can make things complicated. Similar to a Google Doc, Colab allows you to
edit code right in the browser.</p>

<p>To add text to your notebook, you‚Äôd be using a language called ‚Äúmarkdown‚Äù. Markdown is a
popular syntax used to add formatting to plain text like bolding a word or adding links.
You don‚Äôt need to know too much about markdown, but it‚Äôs nice to know the
basics if you‚Äôre interested. (This site was built using just markdown!)</p>

<h2 id="executing-your-first-code-block">Executing your first code block</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Colab website</a>, you should be greeted with an 
introductory notebook. (This intro notebook has some pretty complicated stuff, so don‚Äôt get
too worried about everything that‚Äôs written there.)</li>
  <li>Edit any code block and click the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button on the left side. A useful
shortcut to remember is <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This will execute 
whatever code block you‚Äôre currently editing.</li>
  <li>Create a new notebook. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File &gt; New Notebook</code></li>
  <li>In the upper left-hand corner, rename the notebook to ‚Äúfirst-notebook.ipynb‚Äù</li>
  <li>Copy the following code into a cell, and execute the cell:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Welcome to Colab!'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="example-notebook">Example notebook</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs say we are interested in the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_feelings/">@dog_feelings</a>,
and we want to know what day of the week the account tweets most frequently.
I already have a CSV of the account‚Äôs tweets prepared (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmcelwee/fsi-web-scraping-seminar/main/data/dog_feelings-tweets.csv">link</a>).</p>

<p>Create a markdown cell with the heading ‚ÄúAnalyze Twitter account 
<a href="https://twitter.com/dog_feelings/">@dog_feelings</a>‚Äù.
To add a text cell, look for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+ Text</code> button at the top of your notebook.
This is what that would look like in markdown:</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># Analyze Twitter account [@dog_feelings](https://twitter.com/dog_feelings/)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Create a new code block (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+ Code</code> button), copy the following code block,
 and execute it. By the end of these two seminars, you should understand 
 what this code does!</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Research question: What is the most popular day of week for @dog_feelings to tweet?

<p>Again, you don‚Äôt understand every component here, but the benefit of Colab is 
that you can combine your notes, charts, and code all in one place.</p>

<p>üìà <strong>Exercises:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Given the chart created by the code above, what is the answer to our research question?</li>
  <li>What are some questions that come up from this chart? How might it be improved?</li>
  <li>The header of the CSV is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timestamp,id,text,favorite_count,retweet_count,hashtags</code>. What 
 other questions could we answer using this data?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It‚Äôs easy to execute cells out of order. When you go back to your notebook it‚Äôs
possible errors might pop up if you execute them one after another. The number
in brackets to the left of your code is the order of cell execution.
If you have two code cells and one relies on the other, then you‚Äôll need to 
execute the first cell before executing the second.</p>
  </li>
  <li>By hovering over many of the buttons, you‚Äôll see keyboard shortcuts that are 
useful to remember and will save you a bit of time. Here are some worth remembering:
    <ul>
      <li><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Execute the code in this cell</li>
      <li><kbd>Command / Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>: Create a cell below this cell</li>
      <li><kbd>Command / Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>: Create a cell above this cell</li>
      <li><kbd>Command / Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>: Delete this cell</li>
      <li><kbd>Command / Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>: Undo</li>
