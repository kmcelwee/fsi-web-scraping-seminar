<h2 id="typical-research-workflow">Typical research workflow</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Be curious and find a question that interests you.</li>
  <li>Try to find a way to answer your question with data. What kind of assumptions
are you making when you make this leap?</li>
  <li>What are all the fields you need to answer this data-driven question?</li>
  <li>Execute scrape.</li>
  <li>Pare down data into just the information you need.</li>
  <li>Enrich the dataset with any external datasets if necessary. (If manually
adding data, ensure that the time you‚Äôre prepared to invest are worth the
question you‚Äôre trying to answer!)</li>
  <li>Analyze your data! Build charts to answer your original question. Were you wrong?
That‚Äôs okay! That means you probably had a counter-intuitive result. What 
led you to have a wrong hypothesis?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="case-study-2-analyzing-congressional-policy">Case Study 2: Analyzing Congressional Policy</h2>

<p>What policy issues does Congresswoman Terri Sewell (D-AL 7th District, Princeton Class of 1986) care about? By scraping her account, we could collect all of her tweets and
categorize them by issue <a href="https://congress.pudding.cool/person/RepTerriSewell">as The Pudding did.</a></p>

<p>üèõÔ∏è <strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What kind of concrete takeaways can you make from Sewell‚Äôs Twitter activity?</li>
  <li>What kind of interpretive takeaways can you make from Sewell‚Äôs Twitter activity?</li>
  <li>What techniques did the Pudding use to put their data into perspective?</li>
  <li>How effective is this answering our original question?</li>
