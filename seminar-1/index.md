# Seminar 1

**July 16, 2021 (1:30-4pm)**

By the end of this seminar, I hope that you'll be able to request data from APIs, specifically
Twitter, transform data between data formats, and develop research questions.
We'll also explore the limitations of data-driven research in answering those research
questions.

In the next seminar, we'll learn different ways to analyze data once we have it 
in a format we like.
