* Provide introduction to Google Colab.
* Understand data types and file formats (CSV & JSON).
* Log into the Twitter API and execute our first query.
* Be familiar with rules and limitations of working with APIs.
* Output raw scraped data of a user's Twitter profile into a JSON file.

* Draw inspiration from accessible research driven by APIs.
* Generate basic plots with data collected from the previous.

## Tools

We will be working exclusively with Google Colab. In order to interact with the 
Twitter API, we will be using the Python wrapper [`tweepy`](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/).

## Prerequisites

The seminars expect that you already have an approved Twitter Developer Acccount. 
[Apply for access to the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).
