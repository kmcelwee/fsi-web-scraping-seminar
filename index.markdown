# Introduction to Twitter Scraping and Analysis with Python

A collection of web scraping case studies, exercises, tutorials, and resources for the 2021 FSI summer course [Humanistic Approaches to Media and Data](https://sifp.princeton.edu/humcf).

## Tools

We will be programming exclusively with Google Colab. In order to interact with the 
Twitter API, we will be using the Python wrapper [`tweepy`](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/).

## Prerequisites

The seminars expect that you already have an approved Twitter Developer Account. 
[Apply for access to the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).
A basic understanding of Python is also expected.

## Coding Resources

* [YouTube Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+tutorials)
* [O'Reilly Learn](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/): A collection of every programming
book you'll ever need. A subscription is free with your netID and offers video lectures,
introductory books, and answers to [frequently asked programming questions.](https://learning.oreilly.com/answers/search/)
* [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books.md#python):
    Tons of programming materials are free online. It doesn't matter too much how you get
    started, as long as you just start!

## Vocabulary

* **Web scraping:** Collecting data from the internet in an automated way
* **Python:** The language most often used for writing quick scripts for web scraping and data analysis. If you are using an API, there's a good chance that there's a wrapper in Python. Python has also been embraced by the data science community and has many libraries to support data cleaning and visualization.
* **API:** Application Programming Interface. In the context of web scraping, it is a system used by web site owners to monitor and control how data exits their platform.
* **HTTP Methods:** (e.g. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE) For web scraping we're only interested in what are called "GET requests", a request made to the website's server for information. With that request, you include the type of information you need, and usually an authorization token.
* **Rate limiting:** The speed limit placed on programmers that prevents them from making too many requests at once and overworking a site's servers. This varies from site to site.
* **JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation. A lightweight data format used throughout the web. If you receive a response through an API, it will almost certainly be in this format.
* **Wrapper:** In web scraping a wrapper is a library of code that translates the API into a language that you're comfortable programming in.
